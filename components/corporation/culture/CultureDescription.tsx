          Culture is at the heart of everything we do. We would be nothing
          without our people, and we do our best to remind them of that as often
          as possible. We are driven by our mission to help shoppers provide for
          their families by making life more affordable, while becoming the
          number one source of savings and deals across North America. Not only
          are we committed to our shoppers, but we are also committed to acting
          as a trusted business advisor to our merchant partners to help them
          win in the retail space.

          Our team is a group of driven, motivated, and passionate individuals
          who work collaboratively with one another to ensure we remain a
          cohesive Flipp Team or “One Flipp Team,” as we often say. We believe
          in pushing each other to the next level through continuous learning
          and coaching to maintain a high growth mindset for ourselves, our
          company, and our colleagues.

          You won’t find a team more tight-knit than ours, and that’s because we
          are a team who live and breathe our cultural values and principles. We
          are proud to say that we have been successful in maintaining our
          one-of-a-kind culture, no matter how big our team grows!
