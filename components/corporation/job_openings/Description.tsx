          With the recent increase in costs of living, Flipp’s mission has never
          been more relevant. Flipp’s Shopper Consideration Platform allows
          retailers and manufacturers to create digital experiences from their
          savings & deals content. These experiences help Shoppers decide what
          to buy and where to buy it. Flipp then connects those retailer and
          manufacturer experiences to millions of shoppers through Flipp’s owned
          and operated channels.
